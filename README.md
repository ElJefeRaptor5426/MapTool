Welcome!
=======

This fork is now *deprecated*. Everything has now been rolled back into the main repository at [RPTools!](https://github.com/RPTools/maptool) In addition many changes were added by myself and other developers and we released version 1.5.0. Your campaign will still load and is compatible with this new version.

The links to the right will now point to RPTools for convenience but older versions of my fork will remain available [here](https://github.com/JamzTheMan/MapTool/releases). 

*Note: The sendURL and getRequest functions were renamed and replaced with better [RESTful versions](http://lmwcs.com/rptools/wiki/Category:RESTful_Function). This will be the change required from using my fork.
